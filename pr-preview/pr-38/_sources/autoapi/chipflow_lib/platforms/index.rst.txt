Package Contents
----------------

.. py:class:: SiliconPlatformPort(component, name, port, *, invert = False)

   Bases: :py:obj:`amaranth.lib.io.PortLike`


   Represents an abstract library I/O port that can be passed to a buffer.

   The port types supported by most platforms are :class:`SingleEndedPort` and
   :class:`DifferentialPort`. Platforms may define additional port types where appropriate.

   .. note::

       :class:`amaranth.hdl.IOPort` is not an instance of :class:`amaranth.lib.io.PortLike`.


   .. py:property:: direction

      Direction of the port.

      :rtype: :class:`Direction`


.. py:class:: IOSignature(**kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`amaranth.lib.wiring.Signature`


   An :py:obj:`Amaranth Signature <amaranth.lib.wiring.Signature>` used to decorate wires that would usually be brought out onto a port on the package.
   This class is generally not directly used.
   Instead, you would typically utilize the more specific
   :py:obj:`InputIOSignature`, :py:obj:`OutputIOSignature`, or :py:obj:`BidirIOSignature` for defining pin interfaces.


   .. py:property:: direction
      :type: amaranth.lib.io.Direction


      The direction of the IO port


   .. py:property:: width
      :type: int


      The width of the IO port, in wires


   .. py:property:: invert
      :type: collections.abc.Iterable[bool]


      A tuple as wide as the IO port, with a bool for the polarity inversion for each wire


   .. py:property:: options
      :type: IOModelOptions


      Options set on the io port at construction


   .. py:method:: annotations(*args)

      Annotate an interface object.

      Subclasses of :class:`Signature` may override this method to provide annotations for
      a corresponding interface object. The default implementation provides none.

      See :mod:`amaranth.lib.meta` for details.

      :returns: :py:`tuple()`
      :rtype: iterable of :class:`~.meta.Annotation`



.. py:class:: IOModel

   Bases: :py:obj:`IOModelOptions`


   Options for IO Ports

   :Attributes: * **direction** -- `io.Direction.Input`, `io.Direction.Output` or `io.Direction.Bidir`
                * **width** -- width of port, default is 1
                * **all_have_oe** -- controls whether each output wire is associated with an individual Output Enable bit
                  or a single OE bit will be used for entire port, the default value is False, indicating that a
                  single OE bit controls the entire port.
                * **invert** -- Polarity inversion. If the value is a simple :class:`bool`, it specifies inversion for
                  the entire port. If the value is an iterable of :class:`bool`, the iterable must have the
                  same length as the width of :py:`io`, and the inversion is specified for individual wires.
                * **allocate_power** -- Whether a io power domain should be set on this interface.  NB there is only one of these, so IO with multiple IO power domains must be split up.
                * **clock_domain** -- the name of the `Amaranth.ClockDomain` for this port. NB there is only one of these, so IO with multiple input clocks must be split up.
                * **init** -- a :ref:`Const` value for the initial values of the port


.. py:function:: OutputIOSignature(width, **kwargs)

   This creates an :py:obj:`Amaranth Signature <amaranth.lib.wiring.Signature>` which is then used to decorate package output signals
   intended for connection to the physical pads of the integrated circuit package.

   :param width: specifies the number of individual output wires within this port, each of which will correspond to a separate physical pad on the integrated circuit package.


.. py:function:: InputIOSignature(width, **kwargs)

   This creates an :py:obj:`Amaranth Signature <amaranth.lib.wiring.Signature>` which is then used to decorate package input signals
   intended for connection to the physical pads of the integrated circuit package.

   :param width: specifies the number of individual input wires within this port, each of which will correspond to a separate physical pad on the integrated circuit package.


.. py:function:: BidirIOSignature(width, **kwargs)

   This creates an :py:obj:`Amaranth Signature <amaranth.lib.wiring.Signature>` which is then used to decorate package bi-directional signals
   intended for connection to the physical pads of the integrated circuit package.

   :param width: specifies the number of individual input/output wires within this port. Each pair of input/output wires will correspond to a separate physical pad on the integrated circuit package.


.. py:class:: Process(*args, **kwds)

   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`


   IC manufacturing process


.. py:class:: GAPackageDef(/, **data)

   Bases: :py:obj:`BasePackageDef`


   Definiton of a grid array package, with pins or pads in a regular array of 'width' by 'height' pins
   on the left and right

   The pins are identified by a 2-tuple of row and column, counting from the bottom left hand corner when looking at the underside of the package.
   Rows are identfied by letter (A-Z), and columns are identified by number.

   The grid may be complete (i.e. width * height pins) or there may be pins/pads missing (Often a square in the middle of the package (AKA P, but this model doesn't
   require this). The missing pins from the grid are identified either by the `missing_pins` field or the `perimeter` field

   :Attributes: * **width** -- The number of pins across on the top and bottom edges
                * **hieght** -- The number of pins high on the left and right edges
                * **layout_type** (*GALayoutType*) -- Pin layout type
                * **channel_width** -- For `GALayoutType.PERIMETER`, `GALayoutType.CHANNEL`, `GALayoutType.ISLAND` the number of initial rows before a gap
                * **island_width** -- for `GALayoutType.ISLAND`, the width and height of the inner island
                * **missing_pins** -- Used for more exotic types instead of channel_width & island_width. Can be used in conjection with the above.
                * **additional_pins** -- Adds pins on top of any of the configuration above

   This includes the following types of package:

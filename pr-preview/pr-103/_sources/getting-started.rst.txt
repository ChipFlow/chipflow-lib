Getting Started with ChipFlow
=============================

Welcome to ChipFlow! This guide will help you get started with the ChipFlow IC design platform, which simplifies the process of designing, testing, and manufacturing custom silicon.

What is ChipFlow?
-----------------

ChipFlow is an integrated circuit design platform that combines modern hardware design tools with cloud-based manufacturing services. It enables you to:

- Design custom silicon using `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__  and `Amaranth HDL <https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth>`__
- Simulate and verify your designs
- Prepare and submit your designs for manufacturing
- Manage the entire IC design workflow from a single platform


Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin:

- Install the latest version of `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.
- Ensure you have `Git command line tools <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`__  installed
- We recommend `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`__ as a development environment
- `GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com/download/>`__ is a great tool for workingh with Git repos

Clone chipflow-examples
-----------------------

.. note::
    If you‚Äôre familiar with the `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ command line
    then go clone [ChipFlow/chipflow-examples](https://github.com/ChipFlow/chipflow-examples)
    and jump ahead to `Install the Dependencies`_


If the git world is new to you, start up `GitHub
Desktop <https://github.com/apps/desktop>`__. The first time you launch
it you will be asked to sign in or create an account - we recommend you
take this moment to create a GitHub account if you don‚Äôt already have
one!

Navigate to `the chipflow-examples repository <https://github.com/ChipFlow/chipflow-examples>`__
and click the green ‚ÄòCode‚Äô button at the top. Select ‚ÄòOpen with GitHub Desktop‚Äô and
then follow the prompts (N.B. your web browser may have a pop-up to
authorise opening an external app)

Once GitHub Desktop has cloned your repo you can click the button to
open it in VS Code:

Install the dependencies
------------------------

.. note::
    In VS Code, open up a terminal by pressing :kbd:`Command-p`: (Mac) or :kbd:`C-p` (Windows/Linux).

We use `PDM <https://pdm-project.org>`__ to manage our dependencies, so
this will need to be installed. Follow the `PDM install
instructions <https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation>`__ for your OS.

Once PDM is installed, make sure you are in the ``chipflow-examples``
directory and then run:

::

   pdm lock -d
   pdm install

Set up the environment
----------------------

Generate your API key by going to https://build.chipflow.org/ and logging in with your GitHub account.

Click on the 'User' menu, then on ‚ÄòCreate/Refresh API Key‚Äô Your new API key will appear at the
top.

.. warning:
    Copy it now, as you will not see it again!

Next, create a file called ``.env`` at the top level in the
``chipflow-examples`` directory, containing the line below, substituting
your key from the page above:

::

   CHIPFLOW_API_KEY=<Paste your key here>

Running a chip build
--------------------

First choose a design to test. Here we will use the ``minimal`` design.

Change into the ``minimal`` directory in ``chipflow-examples`` to use
this design. Now we need to ‚Äòlock‚Äô our pins - the ChipFlow tooling will
then automatically allocate inputs and outputs from your design to pins
on the chip.

::

   pdm run chipflow pin lock

We can now simulate and test the design by running:

::

   make sim-check

You should see the simulation model being built and run - and a small
test firmware running on the simulated System-on-a-Chip (aided by our
local friendly cat!)

::

   pdm run chipflow sim
   -- build_sim_cxxrtl
   -- build_sim
   pdm run chipflow software
   -- gather_depencencies
   -- build_software_elf
   -- build_software
   cd build/sim && ./sim_soc
   üê±: nyaa~!
   SoC type: CA7F100F
   Flash ID: CA7CA7FF
   Quad mode
   pdm run json-compare design/tests/events_reference.json build/sim/events.json
   Event logs are identical

Now you are ready to try building this design into a chip! To submit
your design to ChipFlow Platform where it will be built into GDS, run:

::

   pdm run chipflow silicon submit

This should return something like:

::

   INFO:chipflow_lib.steps.silicon:Submitting c23dab6-dirty for project chipflow-examples-minimal
   INFO:chipflow_lib.steps.silicon:Submitted design: {'build_id': '3f51a69c-b3e3-4fd3-88fd-52826ac5e5dd'}
   Design submitted successfully! Build URL: https://build-staging.chipflow.org//build/3f51a69c-b3e3-4fd3-88fd-52826ac5e5dd

Your design will now start building: pictures and logs of the build are
available at build URL that is returned, once it is complete.

If you would like to get the build logs streamed to your command-line,
you can instead call:

::

   pdm run chipflow silicon submit --wait
